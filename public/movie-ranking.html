<h1>The best movies (acording to me :)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Prestige</h3>
<p>This movie is one of the greatest pieces of work, famous writer and director Christopher Nolan has ever put out. Definetly a must watch.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Another Nolan movie, but trust me, it is a good one. From the soundtrack, characters and writing, everything about this movie is great, another must watch if you have not already.</p>
<h3>The Joker</h3>
<p>Honestly, idk what to say about this one. I'm excited the sequel is coming out this year so yeah.</p>
